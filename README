Birding checklist enhancer

Create a checklist for bird identification is Montana.

- This script produces a CSV file (a spreadsheet)
- Uses the PDF checklist produced by http://fwp.mt.gov/ as a starting point
- Data from the PDF was copy-n-pasted into Montana_bird_checklist_raw_data.csv
- process_it.rb then runs and creates Montana_bird_checklist.csv
- it does this by looking the birds up on allaboutbirds.com and doing some scraping there
- the resulting CSV can then be imported into Excel or Google Docs for further refinments into a nice spreadsheet

- not a good example of clean code, just "get it done" scripting.

To use
------
- bundle install
- bundle exec ruby process_it.rb
