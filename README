Create a checklist for bird identification is Montana.

Output
------
All of the output is in the output folder, including:
- the final PDF, ready for printing
- a spreadsheet, with all the birds and all the info gotten by this script
- a csv, basically the same as the spreadsheet, except its one page whereas the spreadsheet has one page per family

code
----
As for the code, well, lets start with this HUGE disclaimer:
- This is not a good example of my good code.  This was done, for fun, with a strict goal of producing a printable PDF for myself and my classmates.  If your looking for good examples of my code, look at some of my other repos (actually, they are so great either ;)
- actually, thats about all I have to say about the code.  Feel free to ask me any questions though...


To use
------
- bundle install
- bundle exec ruby make_checklists.rb
- bundle exec lib/pdf_utils.rb (to create the printable pdf)
